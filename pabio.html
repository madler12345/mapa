    <lead class="lead">Rabbi Paul Hait was a Great Man who passed on June 3rd 2022 at the age of One Hundred and One Years Old In West Hempstead, New York. Origionally from Poland and born in 1921, he moved quickly when he was just three years old because of the concern of war and still remembered it for most of his days. He was a man of great honor. He was a resident for Eitz Chaim Synagauge and was the Rabbi in Jewish Queens Center. He was also on the board of Rabbis years ago. His father זכר צדיק לברכה still has his name in a shul in Skenechtody where Paul grew up many years ago.</lead>
